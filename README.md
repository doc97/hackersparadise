# Hacker's Paradise
A little game project made in Lua with Love2D.

Download [here](https://github.com/doc97/hackersparadise/releases/latest).

## Build it yourself
To build or run the game by using the scripts you need to have a shell
environment. Personally I use Git Bash which comes along when installing Git.

### Run the game locally
```
./run.sh
```

### Export an EXE
```
./export.sh
```
